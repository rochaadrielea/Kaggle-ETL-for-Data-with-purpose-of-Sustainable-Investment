# Data Pipeline Sustainable Investment Insights

The goal of this project is to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process sustainable investment data using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SQL Server, and Visual Studio Code with WSL. The pipeline will extract data from a structured dataset, transform it for analytical reporting, and load it into a Data Warehouse (DWH) optimized for Power BI reporting.

# Project Objectives
Extract investment and sustainability-related data (e.g., financial inclusion, climate finance, and sustainable food security).
Transform data to ensure quality, reliability, and consistency.
Load the transformed data into a SQL Server-based Data Warehouse.
Optimize database structures for reporting.
Monitor and improve data pipeline performance.

# Technology 
SSIS → To build ETL processes.
SQL Server → To store and process structured data.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) + WSL → For scripting and automation.
Power BI → For reporting and data visualization.
